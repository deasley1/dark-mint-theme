# dark-mint-theme
A dark & fresh looking theme for emacs

##Installation
- Eventually would like to create a MELPA recipe.  In the meantime put `dark-mint-theme.el` in either `custom-theme-directory` or `load-path`.

- If in placed in the `custom-theme-directory`, apply the theme with `M-x customize-themes`.

- To set as the default theme, add the following to your `.emacs` config file:

```
(load-theme 'dark-mint t)
```
